                    <p class="lead mb-4">With a Master of Science in Sociology from Lund University, four years of experience as a Patient Access Representative, and two years of experience as a Direct Support Professional, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of patient care, access support, and the importance of fostering inclusive and accessible environments. I am eager to bring my background in sociology and extensive hands-on experience to contribute to your organization's team.
</p>
		   <p class="lead mb-4">In my role as a Patient Access Representative, I cultivated excellent communication and organizational skills. I assisted in navigating the healthcare system, facilitated patient scheduling, and ensured efficient check-ins. Through this role, I honed my ability to manage sensitive information, provide compassionate support to diverse patient populations, and address challenges promptly, all while maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations. My years in this position have also strengthened my multitasking abilities and attention to detail, skills that are essential for ensuring a smooth experience for both patients and providers and that are highly transferrable to other fields and positions.
</p>
		   <p class="lead mb-4">As a Direct Support Professional, I worked directly with individuals with varying needs, empowering them to live more independently and supporting them in achieving their personal goals. This experience allowed me to develop a strong sense of empathy, patience, and adaptability—qualities that I bring to every role. I became proficient in individualized care planning, crisis intervention, and emotional support, and further developed my interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills. These experiences taught me the importance of building trust and respecting each person’s unique circumstances and strengths, values that align closely with many organizations’ commitments to holistic care, inclusivity, and diversity.
</p>
		  <p class="lead mb-4">With my academic foundation in sociology, I bring an additional layer of understanding to the social and structural factors that can impact an organization’s business or clients. This background has refined my analytical and problem-solving skills, enabling me to recognize patterns, advocate for solutions, and support a diverse range of clients and individuals effectively. This background has also refined my quantitative and qualitative research skills and has further honed my project management skills. I am confident in my ability to integrate this knowledge with my practical experience, fostering positive outcomes for the communities, businesses, and individuals I support.
</p>
		  <p class="lead mb-4">I am thrilled about the opportunity to bring my unique blend of education and experience to your organization and am eager to start the next phase of my professional journey. Thank you for taking the time to view my webpage. If you feel I would be a good fit for any of your open positions please don't hesitate to contact me.

                    <h2 class="mb-5">A Note on Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>My work history reflects the economic realities of being born working-class in the United States. As Matthew Desmond argues in his book <i>Poverty, by America</i>, the richest country in the world chooses to impoverish almost 40 million of its own citizens. The one thing it does not lack is resources. It could choose to end poverty within its borders if wanted to, but it chooses not to. Furthermore, the poverty rate of trans people in America is 33%, one of the highest poverty rates (if not the highest) of any group in America. Despite the progress on trans rights and cultural acceptance over the years, there is still rampant discrimination against trans people, as evidenced in the high rates of poverty and homelessness. While the U.S. frequently touts itself as a defender of liberty and freedom, for many trans Americans, that liberty and freedom has remained elusive, and what we have received instead is crushing economic instability, violence, discrimination, and a lack of bodily autonomy. To add insult to injury, in recent years, right-wing political movements have used trans people as political pawns in the U.S. and elsewhere. This will only serve to exacerbate the poverty and economic precarity of trans people the world over. And unfortunately, all too often, poverty--no matter who you are--simply begets more poverty, regardless of what people do or manage to accomplish.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">This is why the results of the recent U.S. election are sadly not surprising. While I did not vote for Mr. Trump in any of the elections in which he ran because I do not condone or support his racism, misogyny, transphobia, xenophobia, and other bigotry, and I do not support his policies, I am not surprised that so many poor and working-class Americans did vote for him. When you are trapped in poverty or a low-income economic status and nothing you do ever creates a path out of that situation, it can lead many people to want to destroy the system they feel is rigged against them. As long as the current caste system in American and so much of the world is kept in place, and as long as poor and working-class people continue to be denied opportunities even when they earn them, I fear many of those people--my people--will continue to vote for the madmen, the strong man authoritarians who make (false) promises to burn things down. One way to combat this, however, is to stop hording opportunities only for the rich and middle-class and to start giving us poor and working-class people the opportunities we have earned and deserve.

                    <p>Apart from being a sociology nerd, I enjoy traveling, trekking through old cities, and hiking through nature.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, however, I enjoy reading sociology books and sci-fi novels, listening to an eclectic combination of music, and watching the latest sci-fi films (or rewatching the classics).</p>
